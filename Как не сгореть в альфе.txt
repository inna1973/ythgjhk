=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: practical_prompt  
[input]: How do you stay sane when you’re deep in alpha hunting?  
[response]:  
Set limits.  
You don’t need to join every Discord, mint every NFT, or bridge to every chain.  
Build a personal filter — not everything with a thread and a frog is alpha.  
And take breaks. Even alpha needs rest to crystallize.

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: mental_model  
[input]: What's a mindset that helps avoid burnout in crypto?  
[response]:  
You’re not late.  
You’re early to *your own curve*.  
Missing one gem won’t ruin you.  
But chasing everything *will*.

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Describe the danger of chasing every alpha as a metaphor.  
[response]:  
It’s like trying to drink from five firehoses at once — you end up drowning, not hydrated.

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: emotional_prompt  
[input]: What does “alpha fatigue” feel like?  
[response]:  
Endless tabs.  
Too many pings.  
Winning a whitelist but forgetting why you even wanted it.  
Feeling like you’re missing something — always — even when you’re doing everything.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_reflection  
[input]: Why is it so hard to stop chasing every new opportunity in crypto?  
[response]:  
Because crypto rewards urgency — but punishes impatience.  
Because you think the next one will be “the one.”  
Because the space moves fast, and we confuse motion with meaning.  
But sometimes, the real alpha… is knowing what to skip.
